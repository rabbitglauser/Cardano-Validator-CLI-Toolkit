5. Cardano Validator CLI Toolkit – DevOps Utilities for Stake Pool Operators
   Project Overview:
   Build a command-line toolkit that helps SPOs (Stake Pool Operators) automate or monitor common tasks — from checking pool saturation and health to reward payout summaries.

Technical Components & Skills Demonstrated:

Scripting (Rust, Python, or Bash)

Use of Cardano CLI and Node

Integration with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

Stake pool metrics APIs

Security best practices

Connection to Staking/Bitcoin Suisse:
Relevant to operations of validator infrastructure — could improve internal tooling for Bitcoin Suisse’s staking operations.

Timeline & Difficulty:

Months 1–4: Learn Cardano CLI and node interactions

Months 5–8: Build and test scripts/utilities

Months 9–12: Add CLI menus, packaging, docs

Difficulty: Medium for DevOps-oriented developers

Real-World Application:
Automates staking operations for internal teams; could be open-sourced or kept proprietary.

Growth Mindset Showcase:
Demonstrates initiative to improve infrastructure and contribute to staking operations.
